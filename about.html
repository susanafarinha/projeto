<p>Hi, I'm Susana. I'm an aspiring Product Designer and Illustrator based in Lisbon, Portugal.</p>
<p>My goal is to create good work for people who are trying to make the world a little bit nicer. Creating human-centered solutions, with a focus on user research techniques and strategy, interface design, prototyping and user testing. I consider myself someone with an enthusiastic and inquisitive mind, always striving to learn more. I highly value both individual and team work, where collaboration enables growth.</p>
<p>This portfolio is a selection of work I enjoyed creating and want to make more of. If you’re feeling it, let’s talk!</p>
